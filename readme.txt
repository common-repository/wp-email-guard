== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How Does it work? =

WP Email Guard is simply working on catching any email address writtin within the body of your post or page, and convert it to a JavaScript code.

This JavaScript code can't be crawled by spammers because it doesn't look like an email address.

= Can Search Engines Like Google Read my email too? =

We don't think that Google or any other search engine is able to read JavaScript content, that's why spammers also can't.
